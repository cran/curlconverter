This is probably obvious, but you need Node installed

You then need browserify installed:

    npm install -g browserify


There are two main files you may need to edit (i.e. to handle new command line
parameters):

  - inst/js/node_modules/curlconverter/util.js or
  - inst/js/node_modules/curlconverter/generators/r.js

They aren't minified on purpose, and I can't see why you'd want to change others.

When they change, you need to re-run this command line in a shell from the
inst/js directory:

    browserify in.js > curl-bundle.js

And **rebuild the package** so the new js code is in the package.
