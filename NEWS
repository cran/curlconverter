## 0.7.0
* calls to `add_headers` & `set_cookies` now have an `httr::` prefix so it's not
  necessary to load `httr`
* the `url_parts` slot of the return value of `straighten()` is classed as
  `url` so `httr::build_url()` can create a URL from it. see next bullet
  for why.
* `make_req()` has a new parameter - `use_parts`. If `TRUE` it will call
  `httr::build_url()` on the `url_parts` slot of the return value of
  `straighten()` vs use the passed-in cURL URL. This means you can
  modify the `url_parts` before calling `make_req()`. This is `FALSE` by
  default.
